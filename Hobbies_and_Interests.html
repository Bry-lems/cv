    <ul>
      <li>Athletics</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Yoga</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Growing up there were always influential people in my life who practiced yoga, but only recently have I began to learn about it on my own.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Climbing/Bouldering</li>
          <ul>
              <li>I started climbing on a regular basis in May of 2022 with a buddy, and currently spend at least 10 hours a week on the wall.</li>
              <li>Check out my climbing page on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boulder_bry/">Instagram</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Hiking</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Hiking has become an almost weekly past time for me. From all day adventures to short little walks through Seattle's many parks, it's a wonderful time.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>Programming</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I started to learn programming after dreaming up some ideas of automating things around the house and in my car. Who knew there was a massive career field behind the skill too.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Home Care</li>
        <ul>
          <li> With my current living situation, I mostly just clean up the house. Luckily for my roommates, I quite enjoy it! </li>
          <li> I also love house projects! Many of my favorite childhood memories are remodeling the houses I lived in growing up. Call me crazy, but I can't wait to tile a floor in a future house of my own! </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Cooking</li>
      <ul>
        <li> In the early years of my life, I used to bake with my grandma after school, now I cook for myself nearly everyday. </li>
        <li> Eventually I will have my own kitchen where I can make all the messes I want, but as of now I mainly stick to the standard American cuisine of easy to prepare meat and a plethora of roasted veggies. </li>
        <li> Cutting isn't exactly cooking, but I love to snack on varying fruits throughout the day. My current favorite, Pomegranate! However, they just went out of season, and I have been craving some figs! </li>
