            This website is the first public proof of my attempts to become a software developer. During the summer of 2021, I moved out to Seattle in my little ford focus, with no more than some vague dreams and warehouse job. Through dumb luck I ended up part of Amazon Scout, where I fell into a project management role. Recently I made the move to Alexa, where Iâ€™m now on a team that utilizes data and machine learning to help third party developers improve the user experience they provide through Alexa Skills.

            On my own time I have started learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), and developing am this website. I am early in the learning process - evident by this website being made with purely HTML - but have some freelance web development projects in the pipeline as soon as October starts. I plan (or maybe hope is a better word ðŸ˜…) to make the job shift during Q1 of 2023.
