A personal website to practice my HTML/CSS/JS learning

https://bry-lems.github.io/cv/

Version 1 - Basic HTML Website

Things I learned immediately after launch:
  - Links should never reference out of folder. All of my links referenced files on my PC.   
  - I am awful at proofreading
  - Patience is key
  
Future Version 1 Updates:
   - Clean up contact me form
   - Set external links to open in a new tab
  
  Launch V2 with updated format and CSS
