A personal website to practice my HTML/CSS/JS learning

Things I learned immediately:
  - Links should never reference out of folder. All of my links referenced files on my PC. 
  - Pull Requests happening at the same time overwrite each others changes... has to be a way to merge requests so I can make edits to all of the files and then merge with main. Seems inefficient  
  - I am awful at proofreading
